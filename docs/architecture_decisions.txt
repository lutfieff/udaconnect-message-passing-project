I use 3 message passing type for this project : gRPC, Message Queues (using Kafka) and REST API.
The application flow will be like this : location ingest service will ingest data to Kafka, it can improve performance, real time processing and easy to integrate, with location data using gRPC because it has capability for large data ingestion and high throughout from mobile devices. Then Location service will be as consumer to consume data from Kafka and store data in PostgreSQL. Related to frontend communicate using REST API, because seems more easy to use and also it has a high performance in term of throughtput.
